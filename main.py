import modules as calc


print(calc.add(1,2)



# You can import specific functions you need.
# You can access the function directly. You don't want to mention the module.
# from calculations import add
# add(5, 10) # 15

# You can also import multiple functions
# from calculations import add, multiple, divide

# You can import all the functions
# from calculations import *
# add(10, 15)
# multiple(4, 5)
# divide(10, 3)

# These will work for classes and variables too.
